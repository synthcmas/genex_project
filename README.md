# genex_project

This repository contains the interactive `run_genex.ipynb` notebook that wraps the Fortran `genex` simulation. 

## Running interactively via Binder

You can launch the interactive notebook without installing anything locally:

1. Go to [https://mybinder.org/](https://mybinder.org/).
2. In the **GitHub repository name** field, enter your repository URL: https://github.com/synthcmas/genex_project/
3. In the **Path to a notebook file** field, enter: `run_genex.ipynb`
4. Click **Launch**. Binder will build the environment and then open the notebook in your browser.

> ⚠️ Note: The first time Binder builds your environment, it may take a few minutes.

## Project Structure

- `run_genex.ipynb` : Main interactive notebook.
- `src/genex_wrapper.py` : Python wrapper for running the Fortran simulation.
- `fortran/` : Fortran source files and Makefile.
- `data/` : Input data files required by the notebook.
- `plot_data/` : Output files generated by `genex`.
- `figs/` : Generated plots.
- `requirements.txt` : Python dependencies.
- `postBuild` : Binder postBuild script to enable ipywidgets.

## Notes

- The notebook is interactive using `ipywidgets`.
- Ensure `data/` and `plot_data/` are present for the notebook to run correctly.
- Python plotting uses `matplotlib`; seaborn is optional.
