# GeneXplorer: Interactive 3-Stage Gene Expression Simulator

Welcome to **GeneXplorer**, an interactive notebook that simulates mRNA and protein distributions for a 3-stage gene expression model and compares them against empirical CITE-seq data for a given gene. Explore how transcriptional, translational, and promoter kinetics shape gene expression variability!  

The main file to run is `run_genex.ipynb`, which provides an interactive interface to vary model parameters and execute gene expression simulations. The notebook relies on `genex_wrapper.py` (located in the `src` directory) to compile and run the underlying Fortran `genex` code in the background. Make sure the input data are available in the `data` directory for the simulations to run correctly.

The key parameters are:  

- Transcriptional rate (`aa`)  
- Translational rate (`bb`)  
- mRNA degradation rate (`gamma`)  
- Promoter switching on rate (`kappa0`)  
- Promoter switching off rate (`kappa1`)  

Simulations use the Gillespie algorithm to follow the chemical master equations described in [this paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0803850105).

## Running interactively via Binder

You can launch the interactive notebook without installing anything locally:

1. Go to [https://mybinder.org/](https://mybinder.org/).
2. In the **GitHub repository name** field, enter your repository URL: https://github.com/synthcmas/genex_project/
3. In the **Path to a notebook file** field, enter: `run_genex.ipynb`
4. Click **Launch**. Binder will build the environment and then open the notebook in your browser.

> ⚠️ Note: The first time Binder builds your environment, it may take a few minutes.

## Project Structure

- `run_genex.ipynb` : Main interactive notebook.
- `src/genex_wrapper.py` : Python wrapper for running the Fortran simulation.
- `fortran/` : Fortran source files and Makefile.
- `data/` : Input data files required by the notebook.
- `plot_data/` : Output files generated by `genex`.
- `figs/` : Generated plots.
- `requirements.txt` : Python dependencies.
- `postBuild` : Binder postBuild script to enable ipywidgets.

## Notes

- The notebook is interactive using `ipywidgets`.
- Ensure `data/` and `plot_data/` are present for the notebook to run correctly.
- Python plotting uses `matplotlib`; seaborn is optional.
